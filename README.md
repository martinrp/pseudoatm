---

## About

This is basic ATM Single Page App built using Node/React/ES6(Babel)/Webpack.

## Installation

This project requires node/npm, please have them installed before running the below.

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
bower install
```

The project uses [nodebootstrap](https://github.com/inadarei/nodebootstrap) as a base, please refer to to this for further information.


## Running Dev Server

The dev server will load a node instance which can be viewed on http://localhost:3000/

```bash
npm run dev
```

Dev mode provides hot reloading of code, which shouldnâ€™t be required in production mode. In production, you should also make sure that npm start is ran by some process manager (e.g. Upstart) to ensure your Node app start on system startup and gets restarted in case the process crashes for whatever reason. Depending on your needs, how you facilitate this in production can vary greatly, so NodeBootstrap lets you make those decisions, getting out of your way.

## Running Production Server

The production server will load a node instance which can be viewed on http://localhost:3000/

```bash
npm start
```
